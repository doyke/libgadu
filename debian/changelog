libgadu (1:1.11.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Closes: #630655
    - Picked changes from 1.10 branch packages.
    - Added a build-dep on zlib1g-dev and pkg-config.
    - Bumped the API version in symlink targets.
  * Moved the git-buildpackage config file to debian/.
  * Modernized and cleaned up the build process: Migrated to dh v7, source
    version 3 and buildtime generation of autotools files with dh-autoreconf.
    - changed from dh_movefiles to implicit dh_install
    - install changelog in all binary packages instead of symlinking it. It's
      simpler and the file is tiny.
    - install NEWS and README in the -doc package instead of symlinking them,
      to prevent broken symlinks in case of standalone installation
  * Added vcs-* headers.
  * Temporarily disabled build-time tests. They sometimes break and hang
    indefinitely. See the "neverending test" thread on libgadu-devel.
  * Corrected flag in example make invocation.
  * Added new symbols.
  * Added a cleanup test/automatic/script/script.c in clean target.
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.9.2, no changes needed.
